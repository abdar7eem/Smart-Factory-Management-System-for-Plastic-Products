# Smart-Factory-Management-System-for-Plastic-Products
The project is a database management system for a plastic products factory that manufactures items like plastic cups, plates, and other plastic essentials. It includes three main interfaces:

  1-Admin Interface: Allows the admin to add and delete employee data, as well as view all operations performed by employees. The admin can also monitor all orders handled by employees and requested by consumers.

  2-Employee Interface: Enables employees to accept consumer orders and purchase raw materials needed for production.

  3-Consumer Interface: Allows consumers to purchase available products from the factory’s inventory, specify quantities, and make online payments.

Project Goal: The project aims to optimize and automate the factory’s workflow by providing a centralized system that seamlessly manages employee activities, monitors inventory levels, processes consumer orders, and facilitates online payments. This ensures better resource management, improves operational efficiency, and enhances the consumer experience by simplifying the purchasing process.

Technologies Used:

MySQL: For database management.
Java: For backend development.
JavaFX with Scene Builder: For building the graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
